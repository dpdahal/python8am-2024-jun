# what is operators?
# Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or
#  logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# + addition
# - subtraction
# * multiplication
# / division
# // floor division
# % modulo
# ** exponentiation

# print(10%3)

# print(4**2)
# print(19//5)
# print(10/0)

# name ='ram'
# print('hello '+str(30))

# WAP to enter any two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations on them.



# Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# print(10==10)
# print(10!=10)
# print(10>30)
# print(10<30)
# print(10>=10)
# print(10<=10)


# Logical operators: and, or, not

# print(10==10 and 10>30)
# print(10==10 or 10>30)
# print(not 10==10)


# Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
# a=5
# a+=50
# print(a)


# Identity operators: is, is not
# Membership operators: in, not in

# a=5
# b=6
# c=a
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not b)

# print('s' in 'sophia')
# print('z'  in 'sophia')
# print('z' not in 'sophia')

# if, elif, else,nested if else

# x=5
# y=7
# print(x>y)

# bitwaise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

print(5&6)
print(bin(5))
print(bin(6))
# 101
# 110
# 100
print(bin(4))
